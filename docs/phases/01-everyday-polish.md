# Phase 1: Everyday polish

**Milestone:** Phase 1: Everyday polish · **Status:** Now

**Goal:** what people touch every day feels finished: the popover never jumps, the main
window's three lists behave the same, and the VoiceOver and keyboard work of 1.29 is checked.

## The plans

Everything in this phase is done (13 Nov 2026), on `main`, not released yet:

- the popover keeps one height in all four views (#599);
- the main window's three lists expand, collapse and filter the same way (#593): a click
  anywhere on a row opens or closes it, the arrows stay, and filtering is the row's own
  **Filter** button (Kevin's revised option B, after he found "a click filters" misleading);
- the accessibility tests read the real main window, sidebar and all (#527);
- the sidebar's button and the search's glass read in the language shown (#621);
- the VoiceOver and keyboard checks after 1.29.0 (#525), which Kevin asked a session to do
  rather than him ("you do the test"): done in a VM, with View and Period now choosing with
  ← →.
